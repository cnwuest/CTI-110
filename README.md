* Cai Wuest cnwuest@my.waketech.edu
* It was super confusing at first, but once i had an idea of what was going on it was fairly easy.
* The name is cnwuest.github.io.
* Once I downloaded the desktop version of Github and logged in, i clicked on my repository and clicked clone. Then I opened it in my "finder".
